### we learned about 
1. structs
2. interfaces 
3. Methods 

- Also Table driven test where we group together tests that are similar in nature and we are effectively testing the same things.
- Also trying to throw every good problem to compiler is good so we can avoid runtime errors and make good software 

# Problems that we encountered 
1. Solving the problem of shape and being able to classify all shapes as one and we used interfaces concept in go to solve those problems 
and said that anything having Area method will be a part of shape interface thereby referring to allthe shapes as they have the Area Method defined on them.
