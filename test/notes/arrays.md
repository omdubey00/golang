### Here is the array one and important one as it will be used quite often . 

- The blank identifier¶
- We've mentioned the blank identifier a couple of times now, in the context of for range loops and maps. The blank identifier can be assigned or declared with any value of any type, with the value discarded harmlessly. It's a bit like writing to the Unix /dev/null file: it represents a write-only value to be used as a place-holder where a variable is needed but the actual value is irrelevant. It has uses beyond those we've seen already.

- The blank identifier in multiple assignment¶
- The use of a blank identifier in a for range loop is a special case of a general situation: multiple assignment.

- If an assignment requires multiple values on the left side, but one of the values will not be used by the program, a blank identifier on the left-hand-side of the assignment avoids the need to create a dummy variable and makes it clear that the value is to be discarded. For instance, when calling a function that returns a value and an error, but only the error is important, use the blank identifier to discard the irrelevant value.

- if _, err := os.Stat(path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
    - fmt.Printf("%s does not exist\n", path)
}
- Occasionally you'll see code that discards the error value in order to ignore the error; this is terrible practice. Always check error returns; they're provided for a reason.

// - Bad! This code will crash if path does not exist.
- fi, _ := os.Stat(path)
- if fi.IsDir() {
    - fmt.Printf("%s is a directory\n", path)
}

#### Valueing the tests are very important write variation of test for variety of cases not every single possible thought 
#### and remember that every cost has a value means the maintenance value and means TDD should be done confidently and carefully.
- [ go test -cover tells you about how much variations of the test you have covered it comes with the standard testing 
    tool of golang ]
