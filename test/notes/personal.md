#### Things I know about golang till know or I have learnt 

# Arrays , slices , compile time error in them , runtime error in them

# Testing framework like learning how to write tests in general. 

# numbers and basic printing like C and bunch of other functions like append , make in the contex of slices. 

# Table driven test and how to make our test more descriptive using key-value representation of the 
# values in it. And this type of test also helps us a lot in testing same type of behaviour at once. 

- duplication and helper are very fundamental to the tests don't repeat yourself and try to make the test must easier.
- anything that is nil will throw an runtime error or panic which is the worst we don't want that.
- checking if something is nill is very necessary.
